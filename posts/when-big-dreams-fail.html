    <h1 class="post-title">When Big Dreams Fail</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>For years, I have thought that what was missing in my life was a dog. I was obsessed with the thought that one day, when it is the perfect timing, this will happen. It was on the top of my bucket list. When someone asked me what the one thing I wanted to do in life was, my answer was to own a pup.</p>

      <p>So time went by and I was always planning for how I could achieve this one life goal. For instance, I saved vacation days for two years just to raise a puppy. Then finally the opportunity came, or so I thought.</p>

      <p>I got the chance to move to another city and be off job for at least three months. This was it! Moving to a city yes, that is a large change in itself. But how long would I go longing for the right moment? I had to take the chance.</p>

      <p>I researched for months and talked about this with all my friends and colleagues. The proudness I felt to be actually pushing towards this goal was immense. Even though the puppy I found was a flight away, I thought the timing was perfect and I got the best feeling from the breeder. I thought that I rather stop thinking and just go for it.</p>

      <p>We had just landed in the new city when it was time to fly out and get the pup. I was beyond excited but also extremely nervous. All research I made pointed to the extreme challenges with raising a puppy in an apartment and I was a first time dog owner, but I thought with 3 months full time this must be possible. I will give it my everything.</p>

      <p>The first couple of days was magical. I posted so many pictures of the little guy and was so proud. The flight had been super smooth and now we had a new family member. I directly started applying everything that I had learnt about raising a puppy, this will become the perfect dog.</p>

      <p>I had a tip from a friend which was that I had to sacrifice myself fully to this pup. He was priority number one. So that is what I did. I slept beside his pen in my new apartment, fully jet lagged. I skipped my meals to surveil everything he did. I dared not to shower when he napped. The cleaning had to wait until my partner came home and could keep an eye on him. A work out was no where to be seen, I would go on walks with him instead.</p>

      <p>After one week I was fully out.</p>

      <p>To solve this, I just kept throwing money at the problem. New Amazon orders every day with new types of treats, enrichments, grass pads, blankets, food and toys. I myself was fueled by frozen tortellini. Trainers came and a dog sitter was hired to finally give me a break.</p>

      <p>That is when I realized that this was nowhere near what I had imagined. The dog would bring me joy, company and energy. Instead I was crying every morning as I had no energy left to take care of him. My heart rate increased when it was time to wake him up from his naps. I was stressing fully about where his next toilet would be. In my breaks I just researched all my problems and scrolled the perfect puppy stories on Instagram and wondering why I was not experiencing the same.</p>

      <p>I had been properly warned by some that this may not be a good idea, and if I really understood what I was planning to do. This triggered me to prove them wrong. I read all about puppy blues but never thought it could happen to me. I thought that flying with him once would be fine as I guarantee will not return him.</p>

      <p>I have just booked the flight home for him. After just 2.5 weeks of what I thought would be 16 years.</p>

      <p>To fail this hard for someone who is a high achiever such as myself will be tough to overcome. I feel immense shame, guilt and emptiness. This was supposed to be my life long dream.</p>

      <p>What I do know is that the puppy will be ok, even better off. He will have a full ranch to run on in just a couple of days instead of grass pads in the shower. I also know that I do not regret getting him. I had to try this dream (or what came to be more of an obsession).</p>

      <p>I will now go back to myself and try to heal from this collapse. My next goal in life I do not know yet. But I am damn sure that this is not it.</p>
